YouTube audio pitch-shift

It is a simple webapp that extracts the audio from a Youtube video and lets you change its pitch. After that you can listen or download it. The app is made in Django and served using ngnix. This webapp also uses ffmpeg and sox libraries for its functioning. The whole project is contained in a Docker container.
